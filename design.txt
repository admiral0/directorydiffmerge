Design limitations:
- We don't handle hardlinks. For us, multiple hardlinks to the same data are
  separate files.
- For symlinks, the symlink target is tracked but it may link to a path outside
  the tracked directory and become dangling. We don't do deep copy of symlinks
  to directories, this also prevents filesystem loops through symlinks.

TODO: does .git directories use hardlinks?
